## Persistent background task with widget app

This app *finally* demonstrates how to do a persistent background task that persists across re-boots and also updates a widget which has a button in it.

It demonstrates three basic features of an app which are frequently asked for in Stack Overflow but still very difficult to find the definitive answer to.

This small app represents my final solution for this problem - I hope it saves you a little time, if you find it useful you may include me in the credits for your app, that would be great.
